<h1><font face="Century">Beauty and the Beast</h1>
<h2>Adapted by Bertie</h2>

<p><font face="Century" size="12"><font face="Century" size="14" color="#5DBb3"><u>Many years ago</u></font>, a <font face="Century" size="14" color="795695"><b>merchant</b></font> had <font face="Century" size="14" color="795695"><b>six daughters</b></font>. The first five <br>
were born when business was good, and he spoiled them <br>
rotten. How they loved their fine clothes, pearl necklaces, and <br>
pretty ponies! The youngest came as a gift to brighten up <br>
hard times. Her name was <font face="Century" size="14" color="795695"><b>Belle</b></font> and she was beautiful in <br>
name, looks, and temper.</p>

<p>The merchant was due to go abroad. He asked the girls what <br>
gifts he should bring back. The <font face="Century" size="14" color="795695"><b>elder sisters</b></font> demanded<br>
expensive things, but Belle asked merely for a red rose.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that the business trip went badly. The <br>
merchant’s ship failed to come in, and he could not afford to <br>
buy the promised presents for his daughters. On his journey <br>
home, lost in thought, he took a wrong turn. Darkness fell and <br>
a storm blew up. Then, quite unexpectedly, in the middle of a <br>
forest, he came to a place where the sun was shining. He <br>
followed a long avenue of trees until he came upon a palace <br>
with a beautiful garden. As he wandered around the grounds, <br>
his eyes fell upon a red rose and he thought, “Ah! A gift for <br>
my Belle!” As he picked the rose, a growling voice startled <br>
him from behind:</p>

<p>“Who said you could trash my garden?”</p>

<p><font face="Century" size="14" color="#B90E0A"><sup>The merchant spun round and found himself staring into the <br>
blazing eyes of a hideous </sup></font><font face="Century" size="14" color="795695"><b>beast.</b></font></p>

<p>“You shall pay for this rose with blood!” raged the monster.</p>

<p>“I, I mean no harm. I wanted a rose for my youngest <br>
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Daughter you say? If she will come to me, you may live. But <br>
should she refuse, I shall visit your house and you shall die.”</p>

<p>The merchant did not doubt the word of the beast. He returned home as a <br>doomed man, not thinking for a moment that Belle would agree to stay with the <br>creature. When he told the terrible story to his daughters, the elder ones blamed <br>
Belle for selfishly demanding a red rose as a gift. She herself said, “Father, you <br>
must take me to this beast before he comes for you.”</p>

<p>The merchant delivered Belle to the Beast and kissed her goodbye, perhaps for <br>ever. Belle tried to look into the face of the Beast, but had to glance away <br>because he was so disgusting to her eyes. But the Beast was courteous, and gave <br>
her a comfortable room. <font face="Century" size="14" color="795695"><b>Invisible servants</b></font> brought her food, and took care of all <br>
her needs. In the daytime, she wandered around the garden, and spoke to the <br>birds.</p>

<p>“Pretty, sweet, feathered creatures, your ways are so gentle, how can you stand <br> 
the rough, ugly beast?”</p>

<p>And the birds twittered back. “<font face="Century" size="14" color="#FEE227"><i>He is ugly but his heart is kind</i></font>, and he is sad, poor <br>
beast, because no girl will love him.” Belle either did not <br>
understand, or did not believe these tweets, and she badly missed her home.</p>

<p>One evening, the Beast came to her room and asked gruffly, “Belle, will you <br> marry me?”</p>

<p>Belle felt sick at the thought and replied, “No Beast, do not hope that I could <br>
marry you.”</p>

<p>“That is your choice,” said the Beast sadly.</p>

<p>“Beast,” said Belle. “If you have good in your heart, you will let me visit my home <br>
just for one week.”</p>

<p>The Beast thought and said, “You may go. But if you do not return after one <br>week, something dreadful will happen.”</p>

<p>Belle went home in a carriage arranged by the Beast. Her sisters were surprised <br> 
to see her, and even more amazed when she told them about about her new life. <br>They were even jealous when they heard about the luxury of the <font face="Century" size="14" color="#5DBb3"><u>palace</u></font>, and <br>
they tried to delay her return. Belle lingered until, one day, she looked at her <br> 
hand and saw a ring that the Beast had given her.</p>

<p>“What is this strange feeling?” she thought. “Can it be that I miss him?”</p>

<p>She rubbed the ring and in an instant she was transported back to the palace.</p>

<p>“Beast, where are you?” she called as she hurried through the echoing halls <br>in search of him. She recalled his words that something dreadful might happen, <br>and she thought, “Did he mean to me or to him, or to both of us?”</p>

<p>Once out in the garden she ran up and down the hedgerows crying, “Beast, <br>Beast, where are you?”</p>

<p>The birds tweeted, “Hurry, Hurry, he is hiding in the folly and there is no time to <br>
lose.”</p>

<p>A flurry and fluttering led Belle to a grotto at the end of the garden. She stepped <br>
inside and saw the Beast lying down. He turned his ugly face to the cold, stone <br>
wall. “You came back,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she replied. “Because I love you.”</p>

<p>“Am I not too ugly to love?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not when you are sweet and kind,” she whispered. “Oh Beast I see that you are <br>
sick. You are not going to die are you?”</p>

<p>He made no reply. <font face="Century" size="14" color="#1F456E"><sub>She kissed the mottled back of his head, and as she did so, he <br> 
gradually transformed into a handsome man, a </sub><font face="Century" size="14" color="795695"><b>prince</b></font><sub>, and that very same day <br>Beauty and the Beast were wed.</p>
